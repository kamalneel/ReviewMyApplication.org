          "essay": "The first time I truly understood infinity, I was twelve years old, lying on my back in my grandmother's backyard in rural Korea. She had just explained that the universe had no edge—that you could travel forever and never reach a wall. I remember the vertigo, the way my mind kept trying to imagine 'the end' and failing, looping back like a broken record.\n\nThat night, I couldn't sleep. I filled three pages of my notebook with questions: If space is infinite, are there infinite versions of Earth? Of me? If time had a beginning, what was before? My grandmother found me at 2 AM, still writing, and instead of sending me to bed, she made tea and listened.\n\nThat conversation planted something. Now, at seventeen, I've read everything from Brian Greene to obscure physics forums where grad students debate string theory at 3 AM. I've taught myself enough calculus to understand (barely) why E=mc². I've started a 'Big Questions' club at school where we debate everything from consciousness to simulation theory.\n\nBut what I love most isn't finding answers—it's the feeling of standing at the edge of human knowledge, looking into the dark. Every few months, I discover something that breaks my brain again: Gödel's incompleteness theorems, the measurement problem, the fine-tuning argument. Each one is a new form of vertigo, and I've learned to love the falling.\n\nMy grandmother died last spring. At her funeral, I thought about that night in her backyard—how she gave me permission to wonder, to stay up too late asking impossible questions. The universe is still infinite, still edgeless, still more than I can hold in my mind. But now, when I can't sleep because I'm thinking about dark matter or quantum entanglement, I make myself tea and keep a notebook nearby. Just in case.",

          "essay": "From a young age, I have always been passionate about science. I remember watching documentaries about space and being amazed by the vastness of the universe. This passion has only grown over time.\n\nIn high school, I took every science class available to me. I particularly enjoyed AP Physics and AP Chemistry, where I learned about the fundamental laws that govern our world. I also joined the Science Olympiad team, where I competed in events like Astronomy and Physics Lab.\n\nWhat I love most about science is how it explains everything around us. From the device I'm typing this on to the stars in the sky, science provides answers to our biggest questions. I believe that through scientific research, we can solve the world's most pressing problems, from climate change to disease.\n\nLooking forward, I hope to major in physics and eventually pursue a PhD. I want to contribute to our understanding of the universe and perhaps make discoveries that will benefit humanity. Science is not just a subject to me—it's a way of life and a lens through which I see the world.\n\nI am excited to continue my scientific journey in college and to surround myself with others who share my passion for discovery.",

          "essay": "Last October, I spent four hours on Professor Chen's faculty page, clicking through every link until I'd read three of her papers on topological insulators. I didn't understand most of it, but I understood enough to know that her work on edge states in 2D materials connected directly to the quantum questions that have consumed me since eighth grade.\n\nThen I found her course description for PHYS 371: 'We will break things. We will build things. We will argue.' That's when I knew.\n\n[University] keeps showing up in my research. The Experimental Physics for Undergraduates program, where students build actual detector components for the Large Hadron Collider. The 'Physics and Philosophy' house, where I imagine debating free will at midnight with people who also can't stop thinking about the measurement problem. The tradition of the Primal Scream before finals—because a school that builds in time for collective stress relief understands something about being human.\n\nBut mostly, it's the culture I've glimpsed through student blogs and Reddit threads: intense intellectual engagement combined with genuine weirdness. Someone described [University] as 'aggressively curious,' and I felt seen.\n\nI want to take PHYS 371 and argue about symmetry breaking. I want to work in Professor Chen's lab and contribute, even if it's just cleaning equipment at first. I want to find my people at the Physics and Philosophy house and stay up too late asking questions no one can answer.\n\nI want to be aggressively curious, surrounded by others who are too.",

Everyone went silent. Marcus, our team captain, just stared at me.\n\nWe had regionals in three weeks and no budget for new parts. I wanted to quit right there. Instead, I spent that weekend watching YouTube tutorials on gear repair. On Monday, I came back with an idea: what if we could 3D print replacement gears?\n\nIt didn't work the first time. Or the second. The third attempt held together for about ten seconds before crumbling. But by the fourth try, we had gears that actually spun. They weren't as smooth as the originals, but they worked.\n\nWe didn't win regionals. We placed seventh out of twelve teams. But Marcus high-fived me anyway because our robot actually moved—something that seemed impossible three weeks earlier.\n\nI learned that messing up isn't the end of the story. It's just the part where you decide what happens next.",
