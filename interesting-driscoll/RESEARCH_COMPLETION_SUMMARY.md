## Integration Status

### ✅ Completed
- **Stanford University** - Fully integrated into `college_admissions_database.json`

### 📋 Ready for Integration
- Yale University
- Princeton University
- Columbia University
- University of Pennsylvania
- Duke University
- University of Chicago
- Northwestern University

All research data is complete and structured in the same format as Harvard and MIT entries.

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Integration
You can manually integrate each university's research from the JSON files into the main database by replacing the placeholder entries (lines 447-561 in `college_admissions_database.json`).

### Option 2: Use Python Script
Run the `merge_research.py` script after fixing JSON formatting to automatically merge all research.

### Option 3: Keep Separate Files
The research files can be kept separate and referenced as needed for the synthetic counselor application.
