## 5. Application Essays

### 5.1 Harker School Essays

#### Student Activities Essay
**Prompt:** "Please list and describe your activities and interests, ranked by importance to you."

**Response:**

**1. FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics | Lead Programmer & Co-Captain | 3 years | 12 hrs/week**

I still remember the moment our robot froze at the 7th-grade regional championship—30 seconds left, tied score, and my code had a bug. We lost. I went home and spent the entire weekend analyzing what went wrong. By Monday, I'd rewritten the autonomous navigation system using computer vision instead of simple sensors.

This year, that same system helped us win the NorCal Regional Championship. Robotics taught me that failure isn't the opposite of success—it's the path to it.

As co-captain, I lead a team of 12, mentoring younger programmers and coordinating across subteams. I've learned that the best robots aren't built by the smartest person—they're built by teams that communicate.

**2. Competitive Tennis | USTA NorCal Ranked | 4 years | 10 hrs/week**

When I step onto the court, there's no team to rely on. Every point is mine to win or lose. Tennis taught me mental toughness—how to reset after a bad call, how to stay calm at match point, how to compete against friends and still shake hands after.

As JLS team captain, I've tried to bring the same intensity to our school team. We went undefeated in league play this year, but what I'm most proud of is that every player on our team improved their ranking.

**3. MATHCOUNTS & Math Competitions | Team Captain | 3 years | 5 hrs/week**

There's a moment in competition math when a seemingly impossible problem suddenly clicks. That feeling is addictive. I placed 8th at California MATHCOUNTS State this year, but what I love most is the process—the hours of practice, the creative problem-solving, the elegance of a beautiful proof.

As team captain, I run weekly practice sessions and create problem sets. My goal isn't just to win—it's to help my teammates experience that same moment of discovery.

**4. Volunteer Math Tutoring | Ravenswood Education Foundation | 2 years | 2 hrs/week**

Every week, I work with elementary students in East Palo Alto who struggle with math. Many have been told they're "not math people." I know that's not true—they just haven't found the right explanation yet.

When Marcus, a 4th grader, finally understood fractions after six weeks, he said, "I didn't know math could make sense." That moment was more rewarding than any trophy.

**5. Piano | Certificate of Merit Level 8 | 8 years | 4 hrs/week**

When my robotics team loses or my tennis match goes badly, I sit down at the piano. A Chopin nocturne can reset my entire mindset. Music isn't an activity I do—it's how I think. Performing at Carnegie Hall last year was incredible, but honestly, I prefer playing for my grandmother when she visits.

**6. Astronomy Club & Observatory Volunteer | Vice President | 2 years | 3 hrs/week**

I want to work on missions to Mars someday. That dream started at age 8 when my dad showed me Saturn through a telescope. Now I volunteer at Foothill Observatory, helping others experience that same wonder. When a 6-year-old saw Saturn's rings for the first time and gasped, I remembered exactly why I love space.

#### Parent Statement Essay
**Prompt:** "Why is Arjun interested in attending Harker? What specific aspects of the program appeal to your family?"

**Response (from Vikram & Priya Mehta):**

When Arjun was seven, he took apart our Roomba to understand how it worked. When he was eight, he rebuilt it—and it worked better than before. This pattern has defined his approach to everything: understand how things work, then make them better.

**Why Harker:**

Harker's robotics program is nationally renowned, and Arjun has already connected with the FRC team during a campus visit. When he saw their machine shop and talked with current students about their autonomous navigation systems, he came home and said, "That's where I need to be." He wasn't impressed by the facilities—he was excited about the problems they were solving.

But Harker appeals to us for reasons beyond robotics. Arjun needs an environment that will challenge him across dimensions:

**Intellectual Challenge:** Arjun finished Algebra I in 7th grade and is taking high school geometry this year. He needs a school where being advanced in math doesn't mean being bored—it means going deeper. Harker's math curriculum and research opportunities would push him.

**Breadth of Excellence:** Arjun isn't just a "STEM kid." He's a Certificate of Merit Level 8 pianist who performed at Carnegie Hall. He's a competitive tennis player ranked in NorCal. He volunteers tutoring underserved students. Harker's philosophy of developing the whole student resonates with how we're raising him.

**Values Alignment:** Last year, when Arjun's robotics team won regionals, his first instinct was to thank the younger team members and share credit. When he tutors at Ravenswood, he creates custom worksheets for each student. Harker's emphasis on character alongside achievement reflects what we want for our son.

**Community:** Arjun's older sister attends public school, and while she's thrived, we've seen him outgrow what his current environment can offer. He needs peers who share his intensity and curiosity—not because he's better than others, but because he'll rise to meet whatever challenge is in front of him.

We believe Arjun would both contribute to and benefit from the Harker community. His combination of technical ability, competitive drive, artistic sensitivity, and genuine care for others would make him an asset to the school.

### 5.2 Bellarmine Essays

#### Personal Statement Essay
**Prompt:** "Tell us about yourself. What should we know about you that we can't learn from the rest of your application?"

**Response:**

My grandfather in India has a saying: "The engineer sees the bridge. The artist sees the sunset behind it. The wise person sees both."

I think about this when I'm at the piano after a long robotics build session, or when I'm stargazing after a tennis tournament. I'm supposed to fit into a category—STEM kid, athlete, musician—but I don't. And I've stopped trying to.

Here's what the rest of my application can't tell you:

I cry at movies. Not action scenes or scary parts, but moments when someone overcomes something quietly—when the underdog works hard and finally succeeds, or when a parent and child reconcile. My friends think this is hilarious. I think it means I'm paying attention.

I talk to my grandmother in India every Sunday. She doesn't understand robotics or tennis rankings, but she asks the best questions: "Did you help anyone this week? Did you learn something that surprised you? Did you laugh?" Her questions have taught me what actually matters.

I keep a "failure journal." Every time something goes wrong—a lost tennis match, a robotics malfunction, a math problem I couldn't solve—I write down what I learned. It started as a way to improve, but now it's become something more. Looking back at three years of failures, I can see how each one led somewhere good.

I'm not the loudest person in a room. I process before I speak, which sometimes means people think I'm quiet or shy. But when I do speak, it's because I have something worth saying. I'd rather lead by example than by volume.

If you watch me at a robotics competition, you'll see someone who's focused, competitive, and technical. What you won't see is that I spent the drive there listening to Chopin and thinking about whether Saturn's moon Titan could support life. That's who I actually am—someone whose mind is always in multiple places at once, trying to understand how everything connects.

Bellarmine's motto is "Men for Others." I don't know if I'm there yet, but I'm trying. When I tutor kids in East Palo Alto, I'm not thinking about college applications—I'm thinking about Marcus, who finally understood fractions, and how his face lit up. That's the person I want to become.

---

#### "Why Bellarmine" Essay
**Prompt:** "Why are you interested in attending Bellarmine?"

**Response:**

When I shadowed at Bellarmine last fall, I expected to be impressed by the facilities and academics. I was. But what I didn't expect was Mr. Harrison's engineering class.

A student's bridge design had just collapsed during testing. Instead of disappointment, the class gathered around to analyze why. The student who built it was leading the discussion—not embarrassed, but genuinely curious. Mr. Harrison asked, "What did the failure teach us?" and everyone had ideas.

That moment captured everything I want in a high school.

At Bellarmine, I would:

**Grow as an engineer** through the engineering pathway and robotics program. I've been programming robots for three years, but I want to understand the mechanical and design sides too. Bellarmine's integration of design thinking with technical skills would make me a more complete engineer.

**Compete at a high level in tennis.** I'm ranked #47 in NorCal for my age group, and Bellarmine's WCAL program would push me to improve. But more than rankings, I'm drawn to the team culture I saw during my visit—players supporting each other between points, coaches focused on character as much as wins.

**Live the Jesuit mission of service.** I've tutored at Ravenswood for two years because I believe that skills come with responsibility. Bellarmine's immersion trips and service requirements would deepen this commitment and connect me with others who feel the same way.

**Be part of a brotherhood.** My older sister thrives in a coed environment, but I've found that I focus and contribute best in spaces where I can be fully myself without social pressure. The brotherhood culture at Bellarmine—the lifelong connections, the shared purpose—appeals to me.

When I left my shadow day, a current student said, "You'll work harder here than anywhere else, but you'll also belong more than anywhere else." That's exactly what I'm looking for.

### 6.1 Math Teacher Recommendation Request

**To:** Mr. David Chen (Algebra I Honors)
**Subject:** Recommendation Request - Arjun Mehta (High School Applications)

---

Dear Mr. Chen,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your support for my high school applications. I am applying to several competitive private high schools for 9th grade, including Harker, Bellarmine, and Menlo.

I've learned so much in your Algebra I Honors class this year. The way you encourage us to not just solve problems but understand *why* solutions work has shaped how I approach math. Your support during MATHCOUNTS season—staying after school to work through challenging problems—meant a lot to me.

To help with your recommendation, I wanted to share some context about what these schools value and some observations my family has made:

**What Schools Are Looking For:**
- Strong quantitative reasoning and problem-solving ability
- Intellectual curiosity beyond the curriculum
- Character and contribution to classroom community
- Growth potential and work ethic

**Observations That Might Be Helpful:**

• **Love of Mathematics:** I genuinely enjoy math—I do AoPS problems for fun, competed at MATHCOUNTS State (8th place), and hope to continue competition math in high school. If you've noticed this enthusiasm in class, it would be meaningful to mention.

• **Helping Others:** I often work with classmates who are struggling during group work. I don't just give answers—I try to help them understand the concepts. I'm not sure if you've observed this, but it's something I value.

• **Response to Challenge:** When I get a problem wrong, I want to understand why. I've come to office hours several times not for help on homework, but to discuss problems I found interesting. If this stands out, it might be worth mentioning.

• **Beyond Class:** Outside of class, I'm applying my math skills to robotics (programming autonomous navigation), tutoring elementary students at Ravenswood, and exploring connections between math and astronomy.

Please feel free to write from your own observations—you know me in ways my family doesn't! I just wanted to provide some context that might be helpful.

**Deadlines:**
- Harker: January 8, 2026
- Bellarmine: January 10, 2026

I'll follow up with the specific submission instructions for each school. Thank you so much for considering this request.

Gratefully,
Arjun Mehta

### 6.2 English Teacher Recommendation Request

**To:** Ms. Jennifer Walsh (English 8 Honors)
**Subject:** Recommendation Request - Arjun Mehta (High School Applications)

---

Dear Ms. Walsh,

I hope you're doing well. I am writing to ask if you would be willing to write a recommendation letter for my high school applications. I am applying to several private high schools including Harker, Bellarmine, Menlo, and Crystal Springs Uplands.

I've really enjoyed English 8 Honors this year. Our class discussions—especially about ethical dilemmas in the novels we read—have pushed me to think more deeply about character and choices. Your feedback on my personal narrative essay helped me realize that writing can be a way to process my own experiences, not just complete assignments.

**What Schools Are Looking For:**
- Strong written communication and analytical thinking
- Intellectual engagement with ideas and literature
- Character, maturity, and self-reflection
- Contributions to class discussions and community

**Observations That Might Be Helpful:**

• **Writing Voice:** I try to bring my authentic perspective to writing assignments, not just what I think you want to read. In my personal narrative about my grandfather, I tried to capture his voice and wisdom. If my writing voice or willingness to be vulnerable stood out, that might be worth mentioning.

• **Discussion Participation:** I don't always speak first in discussions, but when I contribute, I try to build on others' ideas and offer new perspectives. I sometimes notice connections between what we read and current events or other subjects.

• **Reading Beyond Class:** I love science fiction—Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Andy Weir. These books have shaped my dream of working in space exploration. If you've noticed my interest in reading, it would connect well to my application story.

• **Growth:** I've worked on being more concise in my writing this year. Your comments on my first essay ("Good ideas, but get to the point faster") stuck with me. I think my later essays showed improvement.

I know you're extremely busy, so please let me know if you're unable to write this recommendation—I completely understand. If you can, I'd be deeply grateful.

**Deadlines:**
- Harker: January 8, 2026
- Bellarmine: January 10, 2026

I'll send you the submission details for each school. Thank you for everything you've taught me this year.

Sincerely,
Arjun Mehta

## 7. Interview Preparation

### 7.1 Common Questions & Prepared Responses

---

**Q: Tell me about yourself.**

A: I'm an 8th grader at JLS who loves solving problems—whether that's programming robots, figuring out how to win a tennis point, or understanding why stars form. I'm co-captain of my robotics team, play competitive tennis, and volunteer tutoring kids in math.

What might not be obvious is that I'm also a pianist who performed at Carnegie Hall and someone who spends weekend nights looking at stars through a telescope. I don't fit neatly into one box, and I've stopped trying to.

---

**Q: What's your favorite subject and why?**

A: Math—but not just because I'm good at it. I love the moment when a complex problem suddenly becomes simple. When you find an elegant proof, it feels like discovering a secret about how the universe works.

That said, I also love the intersection of subjects. My favorite projects combine things—like when I used physics and programming together to build an autonomous navigation system for my robotics team, or when I connected astronomy with math to calculate orbital mechanics.

**Q: Why are you interested in our school?**

A: *[For Harker]* When I visited and saw the robotics lab, I talked with students about their autonomous navigation systems. They weren't just building robots—they were solving real engineering problems. That's the level I want to compete at.

But beyond robotics, I was struck by how students here are allowed to be excellent at multiple things. I'm not just a STEM person—I'm also a pianist and a tennis player and someone who cares about service. Harker seems to value all of those dimensions.

**Q: Tell me about a challenge you've faced.**

A: At the 7th-grade robotics regional championship, our robot froze with 30 seconds left. We lost by one point, and it was my code that failed.

I was devastated. I went home and spent the entire weekend analyzing what went wrong. By Monday, I'd completely rewritten the autonomous system using computer vision instead of simple sensors. That new code helped us win regionals this year.

What I learned is that failure isn't the opposite of success—it's how you get there. Now I keep a "failure journal" where I write down what I learned every time something goes wrong. Looking back at three years of failures, I can see how each one led somewhere good.

**Q: What do you do for fun?**

A: Play tennis, definitely—there's something about competing that I love. But also piano, which is the opposite. When I play Chopin, I'm not competing with anyone. It's just me and the music.

I also volunteer at Foothill Observatory on public nights, helping people see planets through telescopes. When a little kid sees Saturn's rings for the first time and gasps, that's the best feeling.

And honestly? Strategy board games. My family is very competitive about Settlers of Catan.

**Q: What questions do you have for us?**

A: 
1. "What opportunities are there for students who want to pursue independent research projects?"
2. "How does the robotics program collaborate across engineering, programming, and design?"
3. "What's the culture like on the tennis team—how do players support each other?"
4. "What's something about this school that surprised you when you started working/attending here?"
