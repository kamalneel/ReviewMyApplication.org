| **Hours/Week** | 15 |
| **Weeks/Year** | 20 |
| **Continue in College?** | Intramural/Club |

**Elaboration:**
Soccer has been part of my identity since age 5—first in rec leagues, then club, now varsity. As captain, I focus on:

**On-field leadership:** Midfielder means reading the game and connecting players. I've learned that leadership on the field is about making teammates better, not scoring goals myself.

**Team culture:** Initiated pre-game "intention setting" where each player shares what they're playing for that day. Created stronger team bonds and reduced pre-game anxiety.

**Community service:** Organized youth soccer clinics at local community centers. Seeing little kids light up when I teach them skills reminds me why I started playing.

Biggest lesson: In soccer and in life, the best assist is more valuable than a solo goal.

## 6. Application Essays

### 6.1 Common App Personal Statement

**Prompt:** "Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you?"

---

**My Abuela's Fingers**

My grandmother's fingers are thick with calluses from decades of making tortillas by hand. They are also scarred from the lancets she uses four times a day to test her blood sugar.

When I was fourteen, I spent a summer in rural Oaxaca, Mexico, helping my abuela manage her Type 2 diabetes. Her glucose monitor was expensive, complicated, and broke twice. Replacement strips cost more than a day's wages. When the batteries died, she went three weeks without testing, guessing at her insulin doses based on how she felt.

I watched her struggle and thought: *This is a design problem.*

That realization consumed me. I returned home and started researching: Why are glucose monitors so expensive? What makes the technology complicated? Could a smartphone camera replace an electronic reader?

Three years later, I have an answer—and a patent pending.

My device uses smartphone cameras and colorimetric test strips to measure blood glucose. The strips contain enzymes that change color proportionally to glucose levels. The app analyzes the color using the camera and outputs a reading. Total cost: under $5, compared to $50+ for commercial monitors.

But the device itself isn't what captivates me. What keeps me up at night—literally, debugging code at 2 AM—is the question it represents: *How do we design technology for the people who need it most, not just those who can afford it?*

This question has reshaped how I see the world. When I volunteer in Stanford's emergency department, I notice the Spanish-speaking grandmother waiting longer because there's no interpreter. When I teach coding to middle school girls, I see the same bright curiosity I had—limited by the same lack of access I was lucky enough to overcome.

My abuela can't read the research papers I write. She doesn't understand the patent application. But when I video-called her to demonstrate the prototype, she held her phone close and squinted at the screen.

"Mija," she said, "you made something useful."

That's the only peer review I need.

I don't know exactly what my career will look like, but I know this: I want to build things that reach everyone. Not just the wealthy, the educated, the English-speaking. Everyone.

My grandmother's fingers will never be smooth. But maybe, because of something I built, they'll have a few fewer scars.

### 6.2 Additional Information Section (Optional)

---

**Family Context:**

My father is a first-generation college student. His parents immigrated from Mexico and worked in agricultural fields; neither finished elementary school. Watching him become an immigration attorney—and now helping others navigate the same system his family did—taught me that education is both a privilege and a responsibility.

I am bilingual (English/Spanish) and bicultural, straddling two worlds that don't always understand each other. This has shaped my commitment to science communication that reaches Spanish-speaking communities, and to building technologies accessible to everyone.

**Research Note:**

My glucose monitoring device research was conducted under mentorship from Dr. Sarah Kim at Stanford Bio-X and represents genuine independent work. The patent application (pending) is filed jointly with Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing, as is standard for student research using university resources. I am grateful for this mentorship and infrastructure, and want to be transparent about the collaborative nature of this work.

**COVID-19 Impact:**

The pandemic minimally affected my academic trajectory, though it did impact extracurriculars. My Girls Who Code chapter moved entirely online for one year, which taught me to adapt curriculum for virtual instruction—a skill I've since applied to hybrid programming.

## 7. Supplemental Essays by School

### 7.1 Stanford University Supplements

---

**Short Essays (50 words each)**

**What is the most significant challenge that society faces today?**

Healthcare inequity. 400 million people lack basic health services—not because treatments don't exist, but because they aren't accessible. Technology can bridge this gap, but only if designed with the underserved in mind from the start.

---

**How did you spend your last two summers?**

**Summer 2025:** MIT Media Lab research internship—developed prosthetic sensors, learned that failure is iteration. **Summer 2024:** Built my glucose monitor prototype while volunteering at Stanford ED and teaching Girls Who Code.

---

**What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed?**

The Stonewall Uprising, 1969. I want to understand how ordinary people facing extraordinary oppression found the courage to resist—and how that courage sparked movements that are still unfinished.

---

**Short Essays (100-250 words)**

**The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning.**

When my glucose monitor failed for the 47th time, I almost gave up.

The colorimetric readings were inconsistent. The app crashed. The test strips degraded in humidity. Every solution created new problems.

Then I remembered something Dr. Kim told me: "In research, failure is data."

I made a spreadsheet of every failure and looked for patterns. The humidity problem led me to different strip coatings. The app crashes led me to simpler algorithms. The inconsistent readings led me to machine learning calibration.

By failure 83, I had a working prototype.

What excites me about learning isn't the moments of success—it's this process. The puzzle-solving. The pattern-finding. The stubborn refusal to accept that something can't be done.

At Stanford, I want to bring this mindset to bioengineering and design. The Byers Center for Biodesign focuses on exactly the question that drives me: how do we create medical technologies that actually reach patients? The d.school's human-centered design would push me to start with users, not technology.

I don't need a professor to hand me answers. I need mentors who will push back when my thinking is lazy, point me toward resources when I'm stuck, and celebrate with me when failure 84 finally works.

I'm genuinely excited to fail—and learn—at Stanford.

**Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate—and us—get to know you better.**

Hey future roommate!

Here's what you should know about living with me:

**I will feed you.** My abuela taught me to make tamales, and when I'm stressed, I cook. Finals week might involve emergency pozole at midnight. You've been warned (and invited).

**I practice cello.** I try to be considerate about timing, but if you hear me playing the same four bars of Dvorak at 11 PM, that means I'm processing something. Feel free to knock and ask about it—or just throw a pillow at my door.

**I talk to my family a lot.** Like, every day. My mom, my dad, my little sister, my grandmother in Mexico. If you hear me speaking rapid Spanish into my phone, I'm probably being interrogated about whether I'm eating enough vegetables.

**I get excited about weird things.** Like the physics of why band-aids don't stick to wet skin. Or the economics of pharmaceutical pricing. If I start explaining something unprompted, you have full permission to tell me to stop.

**I'll probably leave my desk lamp on late.** But I'm good at silent working if you need to sleep.

**What I'm hoping for:** Someone who'll tell me when I'm being too intense, who'll join me for late-night boba runs, and who'll eventually explain their own weird passion to me at 2 AM.

Can't wait to meet you.

—Maya

### 7.2 MIT Supplemental Essays

**We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it. (100-200 words)**

Every Sunday, I make pan dulce.

Not because it's efficient—store-bought is faster. Not because I'm particularly good—my conchas are lopsided and my cuernos never rise right. I do it because my grandmother did it, and her mother before her, and when I'm elbow-deep in flour at 7 AM, I feel connected to something larger than myself.

The process is meditation. Kneading dough requires just enough attention that my mind can't wander to research problems or college applications. Shaping conchas requires precision that rewards focus. And when the smell of cinnamon and anise fills the kitchen, I remember being six years old in Oaxaca, waking up to that same smell.

I bring the results to my Girls Who Code students sometimes. They tease me about the shapes, but they eat every one.

Someday I'll teach my own kids to make pan dulce. They'll probably mess up the proportions, like I do. And that will be perfect, because the point was never perfection—it was presence.

**At MIT, we bring people together to better the lives of others. MIT students work to improve their communities in different ways, from tackling the world's biggest challenges to being a good friend. Describe one way in which you have contributed to your community, whether in your family, the classroom, your neighborhood, etc. (200-250 words)**

When Maria showed up at Girls Who Code, she wouldn't look anyone in the eye.

She was 12, Latina, the daughter of farmworkers in east San Jose. A teacher had told her she "wasn't a computer person." She believed it.

I paired her with Priya, a high schooler who'd been coding since childhood. Priya didn't teach Maria syntax—she taught her to debug by reading error messages out loud, to Google when stuck, to ask questions without shame.

By December, Maria had built an app for her mom—an inventory tracker for their family's fruit cart at the flea market. Simple interface, Spanish text, designed for someone who'd never used a computer.

When Maria demoed it, her mom cried. Then Maria cried. Then, honestly, I cried too.

Girls Who Code started because I was often the only Latina in my computer science classes and wanted to change that. But the contribution I'm proudest of isn't the 40 students we serve or the partnerships we've built.

It's Maria, who now mentors other girls and wants to study computer science in college.

Community contribution, I've learned, isn't about the number of people you reach. It's about creating conditions where people can discover their own capacity. Maria didn't need me to teach her coding. She needed someone to believe she could learn it.

That belief is what I try to contribute, every Saturday, in a library meeting room in Mountain View.

### 7.3 UC Personal Insight Questions

**Note:** UC application requires responses to 4 of 8 prompts, 350 words max each.

---

**1. Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.**

The fight started over t-shirts.

Our Latinx Student Union was planning Día de los Muertos, and opinions were... strong. Some wanted traditional marigold-colored shirts. Others wanted modern designs with skulls. A faction wanted no shirts at all—"it's commercializing our culture."

As vice president, I could have picked a side or called a vote. Instead, I asked a question: "What does this celebration actually mean to each of you?"

What followed changed my understanding of leadership.

Students shared stories I'd never heard—grandparents who were embarrassed by their heritage, parents who didn't teach Spanish to help their kids "fit in," the complex relationship between Mexican identity and American assimilation. The t-shirt debate wasn't really about t-shirts. It was about who gets to define our culture and whether celebration feels like pride or performance.

We ended up with no t-shirts. Instead, we created an altar where every participant could contribute something personal—a photograph, a recipe, a memory. The celebration became about *us*, not about merchandise.

I learned that leadership isn't about deciding quickly or appearing confident. It's about creating space for the real conversation to emerge. Sometimes the "dispute" is actually an unexplored question, and the leader's job is to find it.

I've applied this approach in student government—when debates get heated, I try to ask "what's the underlying concern here?" It doesn't always work. Some disagreements are genuinely intractable. But often, the thing people are fighting about isn't the thing they actually care about.

The altar from that Día de los Muertos celebration is now a school tradition. Every year, students add photographs, and the altar grows. That feels more valuable than any t-shirt.

---

**2. Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creativity.**

My glucose monitor started with a crayon drawing.

I was in Oaxaca, frustrated by my grandmother's broken medical device, and I started sketching. What if the phone did the work? What if the strips were simpler? What if the interface was designed for someone who'd never used a computer?

Those sketches became wireframes. The wireframes became prototypes. The prototypes became a patent application.

But the creativity wasn't in the final product—it was in the constraints. I couldn't use expensive components because my target users couldn't afford them. I couldn't require internet access because rural areas lack connectivity. I couldn't assume literacy because many users have limited education.

Each constraint forced creative solutions. No electronics? Use colorimetric chemistry. No internet? Process locally on the phone. Limited literacy? Use icons and audio instead of text.

I express creativity the same way in music. When I'm learning a cello piece, I don't just play the notes—I imagine the composer's intention, the story the music tells, the emotional journey from first note to last. My interpretation of Elgar's Cello Concerto is different from anyone else's because I bring my own experiences to it.

And in Girls Who Code, creativity means designing curriculum for students with different learning styles, creating projects that connect to their lives, and finding ways to make debugging feel like puzzle-solving instead of failure.

Creativity, to me, isn't about making something from nothing. It's about seeing constraints as design prompts and finding unexpected connections between disparate ideas.

My best creative work happens at intersections: engineering and design, technology and humanity, Mexican heritage and American innovation.

---

**3. What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?**

I can explain anything to anyone.

This sounds simple, but it's genuinely my most valuable skill—and the one I've worked hardest to develop.

It started with necessity. My grandmother finished 6th grade; my mother has a PhD from MIT. Family gatherings require constant translation—not just linguistic, but conceptual. I learned to explain my mom's neuroscience research to my abuela in terms of kitchen chemistry, and my abuela's traditional remedies to my mom in terms of pharmacological mechanisms.

This skill became intentional when I started my science communication blog and podcast. I interview researchers and translate their work for general audiences, often in Spanish. The discipline of simplifying without dumbing down—of finding the right analogy, the right entry point, the right level of detail—has made me a better thinker.

Here's the counterintuitive part: explaining to non-experts makes me understand better. When I tried to explain my glucose monitor to my abuela, I realized I didn't fully understand why the enzymatic reaction produced color change. I went back to the research and finally grasped the mechanism—because I had to.

This skill appears everywhere: tutoring students in Girls Who Code, presenting at Intel ISEF, communicating with my soccer team about strategy. I've learned to read an audience—to watch for confusion, to check for understanding, to adjust in real-time.

Science can't change the world if it stays locked in journals. My greatest talent is being a bridge—between disciplines, between languages, between people who have knowledge and people who need it.

---

**4. Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.**

When I was 15, I emailed 27 Stanford professors asking to work in their labs. 26 didn't respond. One said no.

The 27th, Dr. Sarah Kim, wrote back: "Tell me more about your idea."

That email changed my life—but the opportunity wasn't handed to me. I created it through sheer persistence and willingness to be rejected.

Dr. Kim became my mentor through Stanford's Bio-X program for high school researchers. She taught me not just lab techniques but scientific thinking: how to design experiments, interpret failure, and communicate findings. When my glucose monitor project hit dead ends, she asked questions instead of giving answers, forcing me to develop problem-solving skills I wouldn't have built if someone just told me what to do.

But access required advocacy. The Bio-X program didn't come to my school—I found it through hours of Googling. The application required a research proposal, which I'd never written. I asked my AP Biology teacher, my parents, even a college student I found on Reddit to review drafts.

This experience taught me that educational opportunities often require you to advocate for yourself—to ask, to persist, to not take silence as rejection. It also taught me that barriers aren't always visible. Plenty of students at my school have the curiosity and ability to do research; they just don't know these programs exist or how to access them.

That's why I share what I've learned. I've helped three classmates apply to similar research programs and mentored one through her first application. The opportunity I created for myself became an opportunity I could extend to others.

### 8.2 Teacher Recommendation Request - Ms. Williams (Biology)

---

**Subject:** Recommendation Request - Maya Chen-Rodriguez (College Applications)

Dear Ms. Williams,

I hope this finds you well. I'm writing to request a letter of recommendation for my college applications. I'm applying to Stanford (REA), MIT (EA), Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Duke, Northwestern, and several UC schools for Biomedical Engineering.

You've known me in two contexts—as a student in AP Biology and as Science Olympiad captain—and I think that perspective would be valuable for admissions committees.

**Why You:**
You saw me struggle with genetics (my lowest quiz score all year) and then watched me come to office hours until I understood it. You've seen me lead Science Olympiad—not just competing, but training underclassmen and building team culture. You know me as someone who doesn't accept "I can't do it" as an answer.

**What Schools Are Looking For:**
- Intellectual curiosity beyond grades
- Resilience and response to challenge
- Contribution to learning communities
- Authentic passion for science
- Character and integrity

**Context That Might Help:**

• **Curiosity in Action:** You may have noticed that I asked questions connecting our biology content to my research (enzyme kinetics relating to my glucose monitor, genetics relating to health disparities). This wasn't random—I genuinely can't turn off the "how does this connect?" part of my brain.

• **Science Olympiad Leadership:** I worked to change our team culture from individual competition to collective improvement. When we started doing study sessions where successful competitors taught struggling ones, our scores improved across the board.

• **Growth from Struggle:** The genetics unit was genuinely hard for me. I came to office hours frustrated, and you never made me feel stupid. That patience is why I kept coming back, and why I eventually got it.

• **Research Connection:** My Stanford Bio-X research uses biology I learned in your class. If there are specific concepts or moments where you saw me engaging deeply, those might connect to my application narrative.

**Deadlines:**
- Stanford REA, MIT EA: October 25 (internal school deadline)
- Other schools: December 15

I'll provide a resume, my essay drafts, and any other materials that would be helpful. Please let me know if you have questions or need anything from me.

Thank you so much for considering this request, and for everything you've taught me.

Gratefully,
Maya Chen-Rodriguez

### 8.3 Teacher Recommendation Request - Mr. Rivera (English)

---

**Subject:** Recommendation Request - Maya Chen-Rodriguez (College Applications)

Dear Mr. Rivera,

I hope your year is off to a great start! I'm writing to ask if you'd be willing to write a letter of recommendation for my college applications. I'm applying to schools including Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and several UCs for Biomedical Engineering.

**Why You:**
AP English Language was transformative for me. Your feedback on my rhetorical analysis essay ("Strong analysis—now make me feel something") changed how I approach writing. You pushed me to find my voice, not just demonstrate skill.

More importantly, you know me as a writer and thinker. You've read my most personal work—the college essay drafts I shared during your "essay support" office hours. You understand what I'm trying to communicate and why it matters.

**What I Hope You Can Speak To:**

• **Writing Voice:** I work hard to write like myself, not like what I think adults want to hear. You've encouraged this and can probably speak to what makes my voice distinctive.

• **Intellectual Engagement:** I got genuinely excited about rhetorical analysis—understanding how writers construct arguments, how word choice creates meaning. If you noticed that engagement, it would be meaningful to mention.

• **Growth as a Writer:** My first essay in your class was overly formal and stiff. By the end, I was writing with more authenticity. You have the before-and-after.

• **Science Communication Connection:** I've applied what I learned in your class to my blog and podcast. Explaining complex science requires the same rhetorical awareness you taught—knowing your audience, choosing the right evidence, structuring for impact.

**Deadlines:**
- Stanford REA, MIT EA: October 25 (internal)
- Other schools: December 15

I'll send my resume, essay, and any other helpful materials. Please let me know if you have any questions—or if you'd like me to ask someone else. I completely understand if your letter load is full.

Thank you for everything you've taught me about writing and thinking.

Sincerely,
Maya Chen-Rodriguez

## 9. Interview Preparation

### 9.1 Common Questions & Prepared Responses

---

**Q: Tell me about yourself.**

A: I'm a first-generation college student on my dad's side—his parents immigrated from Mexico and worked in the fields. That background shapes everything I do: I want to build technologies that reach everyone, not just the privileged.

I'm a researcher (my glucose monitor project for underserved communities), a community builder (Girls Who Code chapter founder), and a musician (principal cellist). But what ties it all together is this question: how do we create systems that work for people who are usually forgotten?

---

**Q: Why are you interested in biomedical engineering?**

A: It started with watching my grandmother in rural Mexico struggle with diabetes management. Her glucose monitor was expensive, complicated, and broke constantly. I thought: this is a design problem.

Three years later, I have a patent pending for a smartphone-based device that costs under $5. But the device itself isn't the point—it's the question it represents. How do we engineer for the people who need technology most, not just those who can afford it?

Biomedical engineering lets me combine technical skills with social impact. I don't want to just build things—I want to build things that matter.

---

**Q: What's a challenge you've overcome?**

A: Honestly? Learning to fail.

My research failed 83 times before it worked. My first Girls Who Code session was awkward and underprepared. I bombed a Science Olympiad event sophomore year so badly I almost quit the team.

I used to interpret failure as evidence that I wasn't good enough. Now I see it as data. Each failure taught me something specific. The research failures taught me about humidity, algorithm design, and enzyme stability. The Girls Who Code failure taught me about curriculum pacing. The Science Olympiad failure taught me how much I wanted to succeed.

The challenge wasn't any single failure—it was changing my relationship with failure itself.

---

**Q: What will you contribute to our campus?**

A: Three things:

**Bridge-building.** I'm bicultural, bilingual, and comfortable in both STEM and humanities spaces. I bring people together who might not otherwise connect.

**Action orientation.** When I see a problem, I start working on it. Not just talking—doing. I founded Girls Who Code because I saw a gap. I built the glucose monitor because I saw a need.

**Genuine enthusiasm.** I get excited about ideas and I can't hide it. That energy is contagious—my research mentor, my Girls Who Code students, my Science Olympiad team all tell me I bring intensity to everything I do.

---

**Q: What questions do you have for me?**

A:
1. "What resources exist for undergraduates who want to pursue research with a social impact focus?"
2. "How do students balance rigorous academics with community involvement and personal interests?"
3. "What's something about this university that surprised you when you started here?"
4. "If you could change one thing about the student experience, what would it be?"

---

### 9.2 Interview Tips for Maya

1. **Connect enthusiasm to specifics.** Don't just say you're passionate—tell the glucose monitor story, the Maria story, the pan dulce story.

2. **Be comfortable with your complexity.** You're a scientist AND a musician AND an athlete AND a community organizer. Don't minimize any part of yourself.

3. **Show intellectual curiosity.** Ask genuine questions. Follow up on interesting points. Let the conversation go somewhere unexpected.

4. **Be authentic about family.** Your bicultural background, your first-gen father, your grandmother—these aren't just "diversity hooks." They're genuinely who you are.

5. **Acknowledge growth areas.** You can be confident while also being honest about what you're still learning.

6. **Make it a conversation.** The best interviews feel like genuine exchanges, not interrogations.
