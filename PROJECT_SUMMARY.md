5. **Mission Alignment** - Schools seek students who fit their specific culture

### Critical Differentiators by School

| University | Key Distinguishing Factor |
|------------|--------------------------|
| MIT | Hands-on makers, "Mind and Hand", collaborative problem-solvers |
| Harvard | Clear narrative arc, demonstrated leadership, world-class achievement |
| Stanford | Intellectual ethos, innovation, essays weighted very heavily |
| Yale | Humanities-driven intellectual curiosity |
| Princeton | Undergraduate focus, competitive for STEM/public policy |

### Evaluation Process Insights

## How to Use This Database

### For Building Synthetic Counselor:
1. **Input Application Data** from user
2. **Match Against Criteria** from specific university in database
3. **Score Each Dimension** using university-specific weights
4. **Identify Weaknesses** based on common pitfalls documented
5. **Generate Explanation** using counselor perspectives and frameworks
6. **Provide Rating** with specific reasoning tied to university criteria

### Multi-threading Approach:
The research can be parallelized:
- **Thread 1-3**: Complete research on Universities #3-10
- **Thread 4-6**: Begin Tier 1 highly selective (8 universities)
- **Thread 7-9**: Research Tier 2 very selective (10 universities)
- **Thread 10**: Compile liberal arts colleges data
- **Thread 11**: Research UC system unique criteria
- **Thread 12**: Aggregate and synthesize findings
